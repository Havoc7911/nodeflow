# Alloy Workspace

A unified workspace suite for modern productivity. Create, modify, automate, and save anything—then share it anywhere. Build complex workflows visually with nodes across documents, spreadsheets, automations, messaging, and more. One powerful app that works on any platform, device, or operating system.

## Core Features

- **Universal Canvas**: Node-based visual editor (Blender-like interface) for building workflows without code
- **One Workspace, Many Tools**: Unified editors for documents, spreadsheets, calendars, automations, messaging, and organization
- **Platform-Agnostic**: Work anywhere—no lock-in, format restrictions, or ecosystem silos
- **Powerful Automation**: Connect and automate tasks across all your tools and services
- **Smart Sharing**: Send outputs to users, devices, services, other apps, or graphs
- **Cross-Ecosystem Integration**: Transfer data seamlessly to existing apps and services

## Node Categories

Alloy Workspace uses six intuitive, operational node categories:

- **Collect**: Bring information in from files, APIs, forms, databases, and services
- **Edit**: Transform, convert, calculate, enrich, and summarize content
- **Route**: Decide paths, approvals, delays, and workflow logic
- **Save**: Store and persist work for reuse, history, and continuity
- **Send**: Deliver outputs to people, services, devices, other apps, or graphs
- **Automate**: Run workflows on schedules or trigger them based on events
